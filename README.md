# Bug Squash Problem

## Problem Statement:

You have been assigned to investigate and fix a bug in an existing project. The project is a simple task management application where users can mark tasks as completed. However, the application is not working as expected, and several bugs are being reported.

Your goal is to identify the bugs, explain their root cause, and fix them. The bug relates to how tasks are fetched, rendered, and updated in the UI. (PS: Bonus points for suggested improvements or optimisation in the code)

## Codebase Overview

- Backend: Node.js with Express and TypeScript.
- Frontend: React with TypeScript.
